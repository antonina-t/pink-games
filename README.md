# Nostalgic games with React.js

Welcome! This is where we play around with React.js by creating games like Memory, Snake and Minesweeper :)

To get it running locally, clone the repo, and then run:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Here are the commands that have been used to create the project from scratch.
```sh
$ mkdir pink-games
$ cd pink-games
$ npm init -y
$ npm install react react-dom
$ npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader css-loader style-loader html-webpack-plugin
$ npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
$ npm install react-router-dom
$ npm install gh-pages
```
